### Marimo Project Setup ðŸš€

We chose to install `marimo` within our project's local virtual environment (`.venv`) to keep all dependencies isolated and self-contained. Using the `uv` package manager, the installation was a single command:

```bash
uv add marimo
```

To run a notebook, we launch it using the specific Python interpreter from our virtual environment. This ensures all project dependencies listed in our `pyproject.toml` are correctly resolved. The command specifies the path to our notebook file:

```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m marimo edit chpt5/chpt5.py
```

### The Marimo Philosophy ðŸ“œ

`Marimo` is designed differently from traditional notebooks, focusing on **reactivity**, **reproducibility**, and a **consistent program state**.

Every notebook is a standard Python script where the execution order is managed by a **dataflow graph**, not the top-to-bottom layout of the cells. `Marimo` understands the dependencies between cells and runs them in the correct order. This reactive design imposes a few key rules:

  * **Single Variable Definition**: A variable can only be defined once. This avoids ambiguity and ensures a single source of truth for every variable in the notebook's state.
  * **Global Imports**: All import statements are handled globally, as if they were at the top of a script, preventing redundancy and confusion.

When you edit a cell, `marimo` intelligently re-runs only the affected code and its dependencies, guaranteeing that the notebook's output is always consistent and up-to-date.

### Advantages for a Machine Learning Workflow ðŸ¤–

The `marimo` environment is exceptionally well-suited for data science tasks like the `PCA` and `t-SNE` analyses we performed.

  * **Interactive Experimentation**: Its reactive nature is perfect for tuning hyperparameters. Creating a slider for `n_components` in PCA or `perplexity` in t-SNE transforms the notebook into a live dashboard, allowing you to see the impact of your changes instantly.
  * **Version Control Friendly**: Since `marimo` notebooks are stored as clean Python (`.py`) files instead of complex JSON, they are lightweight and human-readable. This makes them ideal for version control with **Git**, simplifying code reviews, diffs, and merges.
  * **Enforced Best Practices**: The strictness of `marimo` naturally prevents common errors. For instance, the mistake of re-fitting a data scaler on a test set is difficult to make, as the environment's structure promotes defining transformations once and applying them correctly.
  * **Guaranteed Reproducibility**: By eliminating hidden state and out-of-order execution, `marimo` ensures that anyone running your notebook will get the exact same result every time.
