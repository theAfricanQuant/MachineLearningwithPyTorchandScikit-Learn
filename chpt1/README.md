Of course. Here is the updated `README.md` that incorporates the Jupyter Notebook implementation, presenting it as an alternative way to run the checks.

# Python Environment Checker

This document details a Python environment checker, available both as a standalone script and as a function to be used within a Jupyter Notebook. Its purpose is to verify that a project's environment meets specific dependency requirements.

It checks two key things:
1.  The version of the Python interpreter.
2.  The versions of several critical scientific computing and data science packages.

This is useful for ensuring that code will run as expected and for guiding users in setting up their environment correctly.

---

## Core Functionality

The checker operates by:

1.  **Validating the Python Version:** It ensures the interpreter is version `3.8` or newer.
2.  **Verifying Package Dependencies:** It checks for the presence and version of the following required packages.

| Package | Required Version |
| :--- | :--- |
| `numpy` | `>= 1.21.2` |
| `scipy` | `>= 1.7.0` |
| `matplotlib`| `>= 3.4.3` |
| `sklearn` | `>= 1.0` |
| `pandas` | `>= 1.3.2` |

For each package, the tool attempts to import it, find its version number, and compare it against the required version, reporting `[OK]` or `[FAIL]` for each.

---

## The `python_environment_check.py` Script

Below is the source code for the checker, intended to be saved in a file named `python_environment_check.py`.

```python
import sys
from distutils.version import LooseVersion

# 1. Check Python version
if LooseVersion(sys.version) < LooseVersion('3.8'):
    print('[FAIL] We recommend Python 3.8 or newer but'
          ' found version %s' % (sys.version))
else:
    print('[OK] Your Python version is %s' % (sys.version))


def get_packages(pkgs):
    """
    Attempts to import packages and retrieve their version numbers.
    """
    versions = []
    for p in pkgs:
        try:
            imported = __import__(p)
            try:
                versions.append(imported.__version__)
            except AttributeError:
                try:
                    versions.append(imported.version)
                except AttributeError:
                    try:
                        versions.append(imported.version_info)
                    except AttributeError:
                        versions.append('0.0')
        except ImportError:
            print(f'[FAIL]: {p} is not installed and/or cannot be imported.')
            versions.append('N/A')
    return versions


def check_packages(d):
    """
    Compares installed package versions against a dictionary of required versions.
    """
    versions = get_packages(d.keys())
    print() # Add a newline for better formatting in notebook
    for (pkg_name, suggested_ver), actual_ver in zip(d.items(), versions):
        if actual_ver == 'N/A':
            continue
        
        actual_ver, suggested_ver = LooseVersion(actual_ver), LooseVersion(suggested_ver)
        
        # Special case check for matplotlib
        if pkg_name == "matplotlib" and actual_ver == LooseVersion("3.8"):
            print(f'[FAIL] {pkg_name} {actual_ver}, please upgrade to {suggested_ver} >= matplotlib > 3.8')
        elif actual_ver < suggested_ver:
            print(f'[FAIL] {pkg_name} {actual_ver}, please upgrade to >= {suggested_ver}')
        else:
            print(f'[OK] {pkg_name} {actual_ver}')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Dictionary of required packages and their minimum versions
    required_packages = {
        'numpy': '1.21.2',
        'scipy': '1.7.0',
        'matplotlib': '3.4.3',
        'sklearn': '1.0',
        'pandas': '1.3.2'
    }
    
    # Run the check
    check_packages(required_packages)
```

## Usage Examples

There are two primary ways to use this environment checker.

### 1. As a Standalone Script

This is the most direct method. Save the code above as `python_environment_check.py` and run it from your terminal.

```bash
python python_environment_check.py
```

**Example Output:**
```
[OK] Your Python version is 3.9.22 (main, May 30 2025, 05:30:51) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)]

[OK] numpy 1.21.2
[OK] scipy 1.7.0
[OK] matplotlib 3.4.3
[OK] sklearn 1.0
[OK] pandas 1.3.2
```

### 2. In a Jupyter Notebook

The `check_packages` function can be imported and used directly within a notebook. This is useful for verifying the environment at the beginning of an analysis.

Assuming your notebook is in a directory and the `python_environment_check.py` script is in the parent directory, you can run the following:

**Cell 1: Import the checker function**
```python
import sys
# Add the parent directory to the path to find the script
sys.path.insert(0, '..') 

from python_environment_check import check_packages
```
**Output of Cell 1:**
```
[OK] Your Python version is 3.9.22 (main, May 30 2025, 05:30:51) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)]
```

**Cell 2: Define requirements and run the check**
```python
d = {
    'numpy': '1.21.2',
    'scipy': '1.7.0',
    'matplotlib': '3.4.3',
    'sklearn': '1.0',
    'pandas': '1.3.2'
}

check_packages(d)
```
**Output of Cell 2:**
```
[OK] numpy 1.21.2
[OK] scipy 1.7.0
[OK] matplotlib 3.4.3
[OK] sklearn 1.0
[OK] pandas 1.3.2
```
